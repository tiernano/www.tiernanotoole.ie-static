Well, this week, the ZeroTier guys tweeted about this.Distributed S3 data storage using @minio and #ZeroTier -- https://t.co/MAXTjo3muh&mdash; ZeroTier, Inc. (@ZeroTier) May 2, 2017A few people then started asking questions, and looking for a follow up, so here it is…First, a quick recap. I had 4 machines, all running Linux. Three of them were in 1 time zone (GMT+1) and one was in another (GMT). Looking at the Distributed Minio Quickstart Guide again, there is a mention of times being in sync… which is probably why this did not work as planned… and by “not work as planed”, I mean that Minio would crash, or not be responsive, or not write data in the place it should have… which was a pain. But looking at the documentation again, they do mention that Windows support is “experimental” which means, hopefully, some day it will be not so experimental, and might work… Given that most of my machines in house are Windows boxes, this would be a nice feature.Now, what about ZeroTier? Given they posted it to their twitter? Well, it worked. it did the inter connect stuff well, and, given bandwidth limitations on a home broadband connection, it was still quite fast.So, the question is, how fast? Well, on my Surface Book on a WiFi connection in the house, behind a Meraki MX64 firewall, connecting to the GodBoxV2 over FTP though ZeroTier, i get the following result:the same download over FTP direct (no ZeroTier) does the following:So, direct over FTP is faster… in this instance by about 70%, but, over the download, it did get slower (seen it hit 12 at one stage) and because its over WiFi, those are a bit wonky…I did get one last screen shot:as you can see, the Zerotier network adapter is showing 77.3Mbps, but the main network adapter is showing 80.8Mbps. There would be other traffic there, but if we assume there is nothing but ZeroTier traffic being sent, there is about 5% of an overhead.So, to wrap up: Minio and its distributed storage system over ZeroTier needs more testing. Ideally, all hosts need to be in the same time zone, or at least have the same time… Will try work on that soon. As for ZeroTier? I am extremely happy with them. Its fast, easy to setup, and easy to configure. What more could you ask for? Oh, and free, unless you need a pro account!",

Well, this is what i have so far:</p><p>First, build your site in jekyll. for me, the command is</p><pre><code>docker run --rm -v \"$(pwd):/src\" -w /src ruby sh -c 'bundle install --path vendor/bundle &amp;&amp; exec jekyll build -s www.tiernanotoole.ie/ -d www.tiernanotoole.ie/_site/'</code></pre><p>next, run an nginx server with that output folder:</p><pre><code>docker run --name tiernanotoolenginx -v \"$(pwd)/www.tiernanotoole.ie/_site/:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro\" -d -p 8881:80 nginx</code></pre><p>the docker container is called tiernanotoolenginx, since i could have multiple ones, and port 8881 is being redirected to port 80 on that container, but technically, it might not be needed due to the next command:</p><pre><code>docker run --rm -it --link tiernanotoolenginx wernight/ngrok ngrok http tiernanotoolenginx:80</code></pre><p>essentially, what we are doing here is running ngrok and pointing it at post 80 on the nginx container… you see i did not point at 8881, since we are using the continer directly… it might be different if you were not…</p><p>when that command runs, you get a screen telling you the URL of your site with some basic stats. your site is now hosted publically, via an ngrok tunnel! you could run that container as a daemon, and leave it running, but for me, i wanted to do some minor testing, so i can kill it when i want…</p><p>So, all is good with the world!</p>",

Even though this is a wind up of the project, there are still new things i have to share.  I found another project that has potential for speeding up the internet: VTrunkd. after some testing, i does seem to manage to speed up the connection, but either limits on hardware i have in house, or limits of hardware in the cloud, or even the software, stopped me in my tracks… i did see 400mb/s out of it at one stage, using 200mb/s from each modem… its close, but its not the full 720…  messing with Quagga/Zebra as mentioned in the previous post has been, well, interesting… I did manage to get all OVH traffic sent though their server, Digital Ocean traffic sent over that box, and everything else over Hetzner. I added an Azure box to the mix for a while, aswell as a Vultr box, but it got very messey, very quickly. if i had something automated, it would be better.  the idea of having a /29 IP range in Hetzner and forwarding it though the tunnels back to the house did work. My Meraki MX64 had one IP address, i had a mail server on a second, everything else on a third, and was planning on using more… but its just, well, again, messy. So, i will be going back to the idea of 2 IP addresses, and hoping whatever i put infront of the network can figure stuff out…So, what am i moving to? well, thats a question… Currently, i have the Meraki MX64 plugged directly into the modems, and protecting my LAN. So far, so good, but due to hardware limits, it maxes out at around 260mb/s. So, thats out of the question for the main network! I did at one stage have Sophos UTM Home edition running. Sophos also have their XG firewall available for home use, so i might try that… There is also PFSense which i used before also… And there may be more… Maybe there will be a new series reviewing these home firewalls? we will see…",

It currently in the process of being decommissioned, or used for something else. It was the main edge router for the network: it had both internet connections connected, and did routing, firewalls, etc, but with the Proliant taking over as a router, it is not requried as much any more… Its still on, mainly because its still a DHCP server, but not much else.  There are 2 Meraki MS220-8 switches next. GodBox1 and Godbox2 both connect in here, and are bonded, as is everything else on the network. The MS220-8 has 8 GigE ports, but also has 2 SFP ports. I bought 4 SFP Ethernet adapters and have a short calbe running between the switches. That uplink is also bonded. All going well so far!  All meraki hardware can be managed though the meraki dashboard. check out their site for more details and examples of how to use it.  I bought one of the MS220’s from ebay a few months back, and loved it. Then i realized that you can get your hands on free gear, the MX64, an MS220 and a Wifi Access point if you attend their webinars. Terms and conditions apply, but check them out!  I have 2 Ubiquiti UniFi APs, one in the front of the house, one in the back. They are connected to one of the MS220’s, but dont work with its POE (maybe the EdgeRouter could do that, since its POE…) so there are injectors for them. Anyway, the network ports on there are VLANed to the MX64 (more on that later) and the detault traffic is going to a management VLAN.  The MX64 has a static internal IP on my DMZ network, and uses the Proliant as an upstream connection. Upstream on the Hetzner server, all traffic coming from the MX64 ip uses one of my /29 ip block. all traffic to that ip is also forwarded directly to the MX64.  I has 2 small, unmanaged switches (a cheap 8 port Linksys and a 8 port TP Link) which are used for seperate things: the Linksys has 4 Raspberry Pi’s, which run a [GlusterFS] cluster, plugged into it and the TP Link connects to my printers.  I also have a Mikrotik CRS226-24G-2S+IN which has 2 10Gbit SFP+ Ports, and plan on using this for higher speed networking soon, aswell as a Cisco 48 port 3560 which also has 4 SFP ports (GigE) and may come in handy for something soon…So, thats the network currently. any questions, please leave a comment.",

The rest can be found here.At the end of my last post I asked the question about routing traffic to different servers based on thier distances, etc… Well, after a bit of messing, i can say it kind of works! here is a quick over view:  server in the house has now got multiple OpenVPN connections (2 to Hetzner, 1 to OVH (with a plan to double), 1 to Digital Ocean (again, to be doubled) and i am planning 2 to Azure as well).  Quagga/Zebra has static routes (currently static, planing on dynamic soon… more eventually) to different servers depending on where they are. for example, all traffic to the hetzner network (including their Storage Boxes) go though the hetzner link. Hubic traffic goes though OVH, Azure (currently) and AWS traffic, aswell as some CDNs go direct over either WAN1 or WAN2 in the house, and some other stuff (CrashPlan currently) goes though Digital Ocean. Everything that has no static route goes though Hetzner…  Ideally, the static side of things should be removed, and a more dynamic setup done. How that works, i have no idea… Spotify have 2 posts about their SDN Internet Router (part 1 and part 2) which is an interesting idea… More digging and research is required.So, there you have it. Everything currently seems to be working, mostly, and tweaks can be made easily… I have a couple posts i have in my head, including something to do with automating bringing up new machines (probably with Ansible or something like it), more monitoring, and some other stuff too… Any questions, leave a comment, and i will get back.[UPDATE] I wrote a quick and dirty app called WhoIsToZebraConfig which takes an AS Number, looks up the info in the Merit RADb (with the help of some code from Coder Buddy) and outputs what you need to put into your Zebra Config… should save me some time, and it might save you time too…  shout if you have questions!",

I was using their $20 a month server (2 cores, 2GB RAM, 40GB SSD, 3TB transfer), and it was all good… But I noticed that every now and again I would need to reboot the box. I also noticed that when transferring large files or using higher bandwidth (400mb/s+) the 100% of both cores were being used. So, I wanted to move to something with more power…I also was limited to IP addresses. Yes, Digital Ocean do offer IPv6, but I could only get 1 IPv4 address… and I wanted more…So, I went back to some old friends of mine, Hetzner, and bought a dedicated server with a Quad Core Xeon E3, 32GB RAM, 4*3 TB HDDs, 1Gbit/s network connection with 30TB transfer per month and a KVMoIP plugged in. I also got 2 extra standard IPs and a /29 (8 IPs, 6 usable). I will explain that next. I installed Debian 8.4 on the first disk, and I am planning on using the other 3 for storage of some sort. I then installed the MPTCP kernel, OpenVPN, Squid and a Socks server (same as the Digital Ocean box) and reconfigured the home machine… All good! Now when browsing the web, everywhere thinks I am in Germany, but so far, so good… Speed tests are about the same, but I have my theory about ECMP to try this weekend.Because of the extra IPs, I am working on doing full IP forwarding, not just port forwarding. One of my IPs in pointing directly at my Meraki MX64 in house (a post on the Meraki stuff is coming, eventually…) and another at the Proliant box, and I plan on pointing other IPs at machines in the DMZ or a firewall of some sort. the /29 is routed though the IP pointing at the Proliant, so that makes life easier. The original IP is only used for SSH and OVPN from the house. it should not do much else. All network traffic in house is coming from other of the other IPs.Again, so far, so good. Hopefully the ECMP stuff works correctly, so I will do an updated post soon.",

The rest can be found here.This post is going to be an update and theoretical post. probably very little “new” stuff going on here, mostly updates, and what I am planning on doing later on.This week, I have been OOF sick, so I have not done much work, but I have been surfing the web, watching videos, downloading stuff, etc., so I have an idea of how things are going. First, as mentioned in the previous post I have MPTCP, Squid, Socks Servers, OpenVPN and IPTables doing their magic. 2 OpenVPN tunnels between the house and Digital Ocean. All TCP Traffic (bar port 80) is sent over socks to the box in the cloud using RedSocks. All UDP traffic is sent direct over OpenVPN. Since MPTCP is in the mix, all socks traffic is actually split over the 2 connections. All port 80 traffic, and 443 (if the client is using local Squid as their proxy) is sent round-robin between the 2 upstream IPs to Squid (2 OpenVPN end points).Things I have noticed:  Every now and again, RedSocks crashes… just full on dies. It’s just a matter of starting again, but it’s a pain…  I have had to restart squid a couple of times… not too often though  there was a power outage in the house a few days back… so, when everything came back online, it was a bit of a pain bringing all connections back to life. I do have to figure out a better planI still have to read more on this ECMP stuff. Hopefully it will do what I am hoping.Now for the theoretical stuff. I started thinking, could this work outside the house? Could you build this into something smaller, like a Raspberry Pi, and stick 2 or more USB Modems in, connect it back to a server in the cloud, setup P2P OpenVPN connections and then get more than a single modem speed download? The problems I can see are around MPTCP. I am not sure if it has been ported to ARM to run on a Raspberry Pi. Second, the max you could ever get out of it is 100Mbit/s, given the 10/100mb network port on board… and you may need extra power for the USB dongles. Also, getting P2P connections may be complicated, given the non-static IPs on the modems, though, in theory, non-P2P OpenVPN could work… Again, it’s a theory.

In Part 2 I did some basic testing of both MPTCP and MLVPN. I also mentioned trying MMPPP using vtund but it has been a while since I did that testing, and it had not been on bare metal. So, this post is a follow up, where I am using bare metal.So, first, the setup:  ProLiant box is running Debian 8.3 x64, and has both vtund and ppp installed  Digtial Ocean box also has Debian 8.3, vtund and ppp installed  walked though the guide from John Lewis and made some changes to the configs. the main ones are mentioned belowOnce done, i installed both iperf and iftop on both boxes, and raniperf -son the Digital Ocean box andiperf -c 192.168.10.1 -don the local box. And, well, the results where not as expected. Pretty poor actually:First, using Squid installed on the DO box, i tried using WGET to download a file using it. If I did this on the DO box itself, i was getting 100MBytes/s… When I ran it over the MLPPP box, well, under 7 was achieved.Then i though it might have been Squid. So, since the file had been downloaded to DO, i SFTPed into the box over the MLPPP link, and tried again… Again, pretty poor result. I think i seen it hit about 7MB a sec at one stage.Here is what is showing on the DO box when running the SFTP download. You can see 2 connections from the 2 WAN links at home hitting the box, and they are balanced. Its just nowhere near the speed they are capable of.I did not get a screen shot of this, but when I tried with iperf, thinking it might have been overhead of SFTP or Squid, I was getting results matching what I was seeing with SFTP. Downloads in the 55-60mbit/s range for download and 40ish for upload. 40 is still faster than 1 link, mind you…I mentioned that I had made some minor tweaks to the configs from what John had written. Well, mostly it was config changes to how routing was done. In Johns case, he is bonding a DSL and a HSDPA connection, so he had setup to do for logging into his PPP modem and connecting. Also, when he setup the interfaces, he routing tables in there. I have mine setup in a single config file, like as follows:I have changed the names from adsl1 and 2 to WAN1 and 2, and the IPs are changed from internal IPs to my public IPs. I manually run this when setting up my connection.Nothing else on his config files have changed. I did not do any of the masquerading stuff, mainly cause this was testing. I just want a tunnel to start with. When reading the vtund.conf file, you can see that encryption and compression are both turned off, and and the same in the ppp configuration. I also don’t think the issue is to do with the CPU performance, since these are the screenshots of top running on both boxes:in both cases, CPU usage is sub 6% for VTUN and SSH seems to be using less than 10%. So, now, I’m baffled as to why this is not performing as expected… More testing required![update 4/4/2016] - fixing images so they are clickable…",

The rest can be found here.In my previous post I explained what i was trying to do… This post explains what i have been working on recently, and performance results…So, first, what have i tried… There are 3 different things i have tried, and here are some of their details. Some will need to be updated (other parts of this series), and others i will try get back to eventually.Hardware and servers usedTo test this, i am using my HP Proliant ML110 G5 running either Ubuntu or Debian Linux, with 2 GigE connections directly to the cable modems, and 1 connection to the LAN (for SSH and testing). The LAN has no gateway set, and the 2 WAN connections have DHCP enabled. They get fully public IP addresses. Upstream, I am using either Digital Ocean or ScaleWay VPS boxes.Digital Ocean has the advantage of allowing different Kernels, so i have been using them for testing MPTCP. As for ScaleWay, well, their BareMetal C2S/M/L boxes have between 4 and 8 cores (4 for the S, 8 for the M and L) and between 8 and 32Gb RAM (S=8, M=16, L=32GB). The L model also comes with 256GB SSD (plus the boot disk, which seems to be a network disk of some sort) and they all come with lots of bandwidth (i use the L because its got about 800MBit/s to the internet).Ping wise, Digital Ocean is about 20-30ms away from the house (I picked London to host the servers) and Scaleway is a little further at about 50ms (They are based in France).MPTCP (MultiPath TCP)MPTCP (their site is a bit wonky as of writing, so bare with me…) is a Linux Kernel patch that allows TCP connections to use multiple paths… Essentially, if you have Wifi and 4G in a phone, and MPTCP is enabled, it should allow you to use both connections for TCP traffic, as long as the server upstream supports it. It also allows for easy fail over if, say, you lose your wifi connection. There is an example video of it on YouTube which should show the fail over parts and this video shows how they managed to get 50Gbit/s out of a 6 10Gb Ethernet connections.When i was using MPTCP, I had a copy of Squid on both boxes, and told Squid locally to use Squid on the upstream box (over a SSH tunnel, which was over the MPTCP link) as a parent cache. Using this method, i could see (using iftop) that both connections were being used. When trying proper performace testing, I setup a RAM disk on both machines and copied a Linux ISO to the Digtial Ocean Box. Then, using wget and Axel I downloaded the files using Nginx on the server, and checked the results. I can max out 1 single connection, plus use about 60-80mbit/s from the second. about 420-440mbit/s total. Disk was not the bottleneck, since I was writing to RAM, so more tests are required.MLVPNMLVPN is a pretty interesting project that caught my eye. The idea is quite simple: you configure the local box and server, as mentioned in their example guide and run the MLVPN program on the server, then the client. It creates 2 VPN tunnels between the 2 boxes, and bonds them… In my case, i was given an IP of 10.42.42.1 on my box in house and 10.42.42.2 on the server. Any traffic over that tunnel is bonded… Problem is, it seems to be quite processor intensive: my Digital Ocean box was showing one cpu core (out of 2) maxing out at around 80% and my Proliant in house maxing around the 70% mark… all while transferring data at around 100mbit/s. I tried iperf and got the following:getting 50mbit/s upload is good, in reality, since in theory my max speed would be 72, without overhead. but 116mb/s down is less than a third the max speed of a single connection. So, I tried just uploads and downloads…Upload Only (from local machine to server)Download Only (from server to local machine)As you can see, the download speed has increased a little, to 176Mbit/s, but the upload speed is now at over 60MBit/s!Still.. download is as important as upload, and given I haven’t managed to get it to max out one connection, never mind 2, even more testing is required…MLPPP (using VTUN)This is one i need to come back to… Used the guide from John Lewis but was only managing to get about 100Mbit/s… I was originally using a VM (so disk may have been the issue) and also had the connection behind my EdgeRouter, so it might have been firewall rules causing a slow down. But I do need to come back to this soon… Watch this space.Conclusions?Well, at the moment, all I can conclude is that there is more testing required. Upload wise, i can somewhat use most of my bandwidth with MLVPN, and I did see promising results with MPTCP. I gave up a bit too early with MLPPP, so more testing is required with that. Also, all tests are using just iperf between boxes. I did use squid with the MPTCP box for a while, but not for proper performance testing. So, even once this is all sorted out, i will need to turn this into a proper “router” too… So, conclusion? this was originally meant to be a 2 parter… now it looks like I will require a lot more parts… Watch this space…",

When I started, i think the modems where 150/50kbit/s and 600/150kb/s, and have steadily increased in speed, currently at 360/36Mbit/s each… But they have always been somewhat separate, and single thread downloads have always been limited to 1 of the connections… I have been looking for ways around this for years…It started with a Linksys RV042 router which allowed me to load balance my connections… At the time, and i cant even remember when this was, my total bandwidth would not exceed the router. The RV042 has 2 10/100mbit WAN links and 4 100mb/s LAN links…So, when the connection bandwidth increased, I moved to a new router…The next router vendor i tried was Mikrotik. I tried a few different options, including an RB1100 and running their RouterOS on x86 hardware… Both worked, well, ok, and the Load balancing with nth stuff did do what i needed, along with other stuff, like routing traffic destined for some sites (like BBC iPlayer) to go over a VPN. But in the end, hardware issues and performance problems with the x86 machine (Mikrotik at the time was limited to 2GB of RAM on x86 hardware) I ended up at PfSense.PfSense was installed on the same hardware, a HP ProLiant ML110 G5 with 8GB RAM, a Core2Quad processor and 12 GigE Network cards… And, on PfSense, things were good… Performance was stable, load balancing worked as expected, I could set some traffic to go over certain links, etc. all was good… But I lacked IPv6… Plus, the HP used a LOT of power…The current instalment of my network uses a Ubiquiti Networks Edge Router POE.

Its a fairly simple Windows application to upload files to BackBlaze B2. If you are not familiar with BackBlaze, they provide unlimited backup storage for the low price of a fiver a month. They are the guys who design the BackBlaze storage pods (I want one, by the way!) that allow them to provide unlimited storage for the fiver a month (I currently backup over 4Tb to them!), and late last year, they started offing B2 which is a storage platform on their pods, and it has a (somewhat) easy to use API. AND ITS CHEAP! half a cent, up 0.5c, per gig stored per month! That’s crazy cheap!B2Uploader uses the B2 API to upload files (it could do more, but currently, as the name suggests, its upload only). Its quite simple, and all the code is available. More stuff coming over the next few weeks. some of the usual badges for open source applications are below. if you want to shout at me, shout in the Gitter chatroom and I will reply. You can see the latest builds over on travis-ci, and the latest releases are available on GitHub.The second project is still in the planning phase, and it’s an update to an older project I was working on called HubicTesting. The name is very cleverly called, wait for it… HubicTesting 2.0! I have mentioned Hubic before here. Cheap (about a tenner a month) for lots of storage (10TB!) but an odd API.. It uses Swift for storage, but has a weird(ish) API for authentication. Anyway, more details will be on the site once I write it up.So, anyone needing to upload files to B2, check out B2Uploader. Want to work with stuff on Hubic, check out HubicTesting 2.0. Any questions, drop me a mail or find me on the Gitter channel. Have a good one!",

AND ITS CHEAP! half a cent, up 0.5c, per gig stored per month! That’s crazy cheap!</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/tiernano/b2uploader\">B2Uploader</a> uses the B2 API to upload files (it could do more, but currently, as the name suggests, its upload only). Its quite simple, and all the code is available. More stuff coming over the next few weeks. some of the usual badges for open source applications are below. if you want to shout at me, shout in the <a href=\"https://Gitter.im/tiernano/b2uploader\">Gitter chatroom</a> and I will reply. You can see the latest builds over on <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/tiernano/b2uploader\">travis-ci</a>, and the <a href=\"https://github.com/tiernano/b2uploader/releases\">latest releases</a> are available on GitHub.</p><p><a href=\"https://Gitter.im/tiernano/b2uploader?utm_source=badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_campaign=pr-badge&amp;utm_content=badge\"><img src=\"https://badges.Gitter.im/tiernano/b2uploader.svg\" alt=\"Join the chat at https://Gitter.im/tiernano/b2uploader\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/tiernano/b2uploader\"><img src=\"https://travis-ci.org/tiernano/b2uploader.svg?branch=master\" alt=\"Build Status\" /></a></p><p>The second project is still in the planning phase, and it’s an update to an older project I was working on called <a href=\"https://github.com/tiernano/HubicTesting\">HubicTesting</a>. The name is very cleverly called, wait for it… <a href=\"https://github.com/tiernano/HubicTesting2.0\">HubicTesting 2.0</a>! I have mentioned <a href=\"http://www.hubic.com\">Hubic</a> before <a href=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2015/03/31/HubiC_SWIFT_CURL.html\">here</a>. Cheap (about a tenner a month) for lots of storage (10TB!) but an odd API.. It uses <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/\">Swift</a> for storage, but has a weird(ish) API for authentication. Anyway, more details will be on the site once I write it up.</p><p>So, anyone needing to upload files to B2, check out <a href=\"https://github.com/tiernano/b2uploader\">B2Uploader</a>. Want to work with stuff on Hubic, check out <a href=\"https://github.com/tiernano/HubicTesting2.0\">HubicTesting 2.0</a>. Any questions, drop me a mail or find me on the Gitter channel. Have a good one!</p>",

I have 2 of these in GodBox 2, and you can get them into a microATX board. There does seem to be some limits with the microatx boards, but hopefully enough searching will find me what i am looking for. Ideally, i want it to take “normal” DDR3/4 memory (not SODIMMs like the ASRock one above) and also take enough of them to run 64 or 128Gb of ram (thinking 8 would do the job!). Also, i would like to have 4 GigE ports onboard and 1 management port. 4 onboard is not a hard requirement: If i can get one with 2 ports, i can always get a 4 port card for the PCI-Express slot… Finally, i would like it to have at least 6 SATA ports and possibly an MSATA port. Thinking Boot off MSATA (Windows Server 2016 Nano Server would be used), 2 SSDs and 4 HDDs. Using Storage Spaces, use the 2 SSDs as “Fast” storage for the pool.I also think i moved off the idea of 10Gb. I like the idea of it, but given a small 10Gb switch costs upwards of a grand, and the plan is to build a machine for that price, i would prefer a fifth machine and using my existing Cisco 48 port switch and leave 10Gb as a future upgrade.Also, changed from last time round is machine count. Originally i was saying 3-4 machines… now i am thinking 6-7… 5-6 of them should be Hyper-V boxes and the last one would be a Media Box.I also think the Synology or SAN requirement is out… Hyper-V can be setup to do replication between hosts, and with a 4Gb link to the LAN, i think i should be OK. Also, if i have the media box separate, i should be ok there too. I will detail the media center in a later post.So, any suggestions or thoughts on what should and shouldn’t be looked at?",

It has a quad core Xeon, 32Gb ram, 3x3Tb hdds, RAID controller and KVMoIP. one of the first thing i did was get myself a /29 IP pool (8 total, 6 usable IPs). There where already 3 IPs given to me: 1 for the KVM, one for the box itself, and 1 as the router for the IP block.So, i need to setup my own router, so i picked PFSense since its what i run in house. I gave it 2 network connections: 1 connected to the main network adapter on the VMWare ESXi box (public) and one to a virtual switch, which is only used by VMs. The public is the WAN link and it gets a static IP from Hetzner, and the virtual switch is then my “LAN” link. This allows me to have standard NATed network connections to any VM i have, but then, what do i do with those IPs?So, after a lot of digging, i found the answer. So, this should help.  Under firewall, click on Virtual IPs.  click the plus. I then selected IP alias, selected the WAN interface and set the IP to my first public IP i wanted to give. in my case, i was given a /29 block, and my first address was 176. This is the network address. I used 177. Likewise, my last address is 183, but that cannot be used either as its a broadcast address. give it a description and then hit OK. Repease for all IPs you want to use. TIP: Give each a meaningful description!  Next, click firewall, NAT and 1:1. Click the add button and select your interface as WAN. set the External Subnet IP as the one you want to use and your internal IP as the machine that will have it. Thats all i did on that screen…  Then go to Firewall, NAT, outbound… this is where things got complicated. Set the mode to “Manual outbound NAT rule generation (AON - Advanced Outbound NAT)” and click save.  Then create a new rule: Interface: WAN, Source, Network, IP of the internal machine and then under translation, under address select the IP you want to give it. If you followed my tip in step 2, you should see the descriptions in here.After saving everything and reloading the firewall, visiting a page like WhatsMyIP or ICanHazIP should show you your public IP. You can then create firewall rules to allow access. Quick idea would be:Firewall/Rules, Add, Interface WAN, Destination: Local IP you want to use, and give whatever “normal” rules you would (HTTP, lock down to source address, etc).

            "content_text": "About a month ago, while i was recovering from surgery, i attended a Webinar onCisco Meraki devices. After the webinar, i was contacted by Maraki and given a MR18 with a 3 year license, to play with and evaluate. So, i set it up in the house and all was good.Thing is, the wifi in the house was grand previously. I have a Routerboard RB951G which does the job and has no issues. And because i am mostly offsite in the office i work, and because i need to remotely manage the network, the MR18 is going into the office from tomorrow morning. I may talk about the MR18 and the rest of the Meraki gear later on, but this is not that post. This post is about something the MR18 did, and i wanted to do on the RB951.So, the MR18 allows you to create multiple Wifi SSIDs, each with different encryption and security and can use different VLANs. Now, the Mikrotik does the same, but the VLANs stuff is not that easy to figure out. but essentially, what i needed to do was as follows:create your new wifi SSIDs:/interface wirelessadd master-interface=wlan1 name=wlan1.10 ssid=vlan10add master-interface=wlan1 name=wlan1.20 ssid=vlan20next, create your vlans. these need to be connected back to your mainethernet connection. In the case of my RB951, there are 5 ethernetports. 1 is the gateway back to my Cisco switch and on to my PFSense router. 2-5 are all slaves of number 1, which is a master. So, 1 is essentially a trunk network. So, vlans are created on that./interface vlanadd name=vlan10 interface=ether1-gateway name=ether1.10 vlan-id=10add name=vlan20 interface=ether1-gateway name=ether1.20 vlan-id=20next, a bridge to connect them/interface bridgeadd name=vlan10add name=vlan20and connect them to the bridge/interface bridge portadd bridge=vlan10 interface ether1.10add bridge=vlan10 interface wlan1.10add bridge=vlan20 interface ether1.20add bridge=vlan20 interface wlan1.20And thats all i needed to do. I have a Sophos UTM Home edition running on a vm for testing, which vlan10 is connected to. It has an upstream connection back to the PFSense box, which has it firewalled off and allows it outside the network, not nothing else. I am planning on doing this with other firewalls, just to do some testing with. This allows me to connect my phone or laptop, or any other wifi device, to a given wifi connection and then be on my way. I also have an older Dell PowerConnect switch, which, if i ever get around to it, will have multiple connections back to the Cisco and then allow physical devices to connect to different vlans.Any questions, comments, etc, leave a comment blow.",

And because i am mostly offsite in the office i work, and because i need to remotely manage the network, the MR18 is going into the office from tomorrow morning. I may talk about the MR18 and the rest of the Meraki gear later on, but this is not that post. This post is about something the MR18 did, and i wanted to do on the RB951.</p><p>So, the MR18 allows you to create multiple Wifi SSIDs, each with different encryption and security and can use different VLANs. Now, the Mikrotik does the same, but the VLANs stuff is not that easy to figure out. but essentially, what i needed to do was as follows:</p><p>create your new wifi SSIDs:</p><pre><code>/interface wirelessadd master-interface=wlan1 name=wlan1.10 ssid=vlan10add master-interface=wlan1 name=wlan1.20 ssid=vlan20</code></pre><p>next, create your vlans. these need to be connected back to your mainethernet connection. In the case of my RB951, there are 5 ethernetports. 1 is the gateway back to my Cisco switch and on to my <a href=\"http://www.pfsense.org\">PFSense</a> router. 2-5 are all slaves of number 1, which is a master. So, 1 is essentially a trunk network. So, vlans are created on that.</p><pre><code>/interface vlanadd name=vlan10 interface=ether1-gateway name=ether1.10 vlan-id=10add name=vlan20 interface=ether1-gateway name=ether1.20 vlan-id=20</code></pre><p>next, a bridge to connect them</p><pre><code>/interface bridgeadd name=vlan10add name=vlan20</code></pre><p>and connect them to the bridge</p><pre><code>/interface bridge portadd bridge=vlan10 interface ether1.10add bridge=vlan10 interface wlan1.10add bridge=vlan20 interface ether1.20add bridge=vlan20 interface wlan1.20</code></pre><p>And thats all i needed to do. I have a <a href=\"https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/free-tools/sophos-utm-home-edition.aspx\">Sophos UTM Home edition</a> running on a vm for testing, which vlan10 is connected to. It has an upstream connection back to the PFSense box, which has it firewalled off and allows it outside the network, not nothing else. I am planning on doing this with other firewalls, just to do some testing with. This allows me to connect my phone or laptop, or any other wifi device, to a given wifi connection and then be on my way. I also have an older Dell PowerConnect switch, which, if i ever get around to it, will have multiple connections back to the Cisco and then allow physical devices to connect to different vlans.</p><p>Any questions, comments, etc, leave a comment blow.</p>",
